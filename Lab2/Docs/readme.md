File commands.ipynb has been created to properly process given data.

It imports the data from the folder 'Original data' and puts it into a DataFrame structure.
Then it changes names of columns to shorter, more readable ones.
The next step is removing the records with insufficient data.
After it has been done, a new table is created with age, gender and a single question columns.
Having this processing done, the two tables are saved to .csv files and stored in the 'Analysis data' folder.
