The final paper

As a result of the analysis, two .csv files have been created:
 - new_data.csv, which is the original data with the names of the columns' modified
 - small_data.csv, which contains only three columns from the original data: age, gender and the belief in the occurence of the Big One in one's lifetime

12 records have been removed due to lacking data.
